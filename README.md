## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Svelte [Transition + State Management API's]
- TypeScript
- WindiCSS [Flexbox + Grid]
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite

### Continued development

Animations and Transitions are amazing for spycing things up a little. Guess I should learn more about them.

### Useful resources

- [Svelte Easing Functions Visualisation](https://svelte.dev/repl/6904f0306d6f4985b55f5f9673f762ef?version=3.4.1) - This Svelte REPL is insane for visualising how the built-in easing functions work and look like!
- [Svelte Docs on Transitions](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-transition) - Good to know
